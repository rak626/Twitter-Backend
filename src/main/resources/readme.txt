A twitter clone backend app using Spring Boot would likely have the following features:

User authentication and registration:
Users would be able to register for an account and log in to the app using their email and password.

Creating and viewing tweets:
Users would be able to create tweets,
including a text message and an optional image,
and view tweets from other users.

Following and unfollowing users:
Users would be able to follow and unfollow other users,
allowing them to view tweets from only the users they follow.

Liking and retweeting tweets:
Users would be able to like and retweet tweets,
which would increase the visibility of the tweet and show support for the original author.

Searching for tweets:
Users would be able to search for tweets by keywords and hashtags.

Sending and receiving direct messages:
Users would be able to send direct messages to other users and receive messages from other users.

User profile pages:
Users would be able to view their own profile page,
which would show their tweets and information about their account,
as well as view the profile pages of other users.

Push notifications:
Users would receive push notifications when they receive a direct message,
when someone likes or retweets one of their tweets,
or when someone follows or unfollows them.

Trending topics:
The app would show a list of trending topics,
which would be generated based on the popularity of tweets with certain hashtags.

Analytics:
There would be a dashboard where the administrator can see the number of registered users,
number of tweets, number of likes, number of retweets, etc.

Note:
This is a general overview of the features that a twitter clone backend app using Spring Boot might have,
and the actual features included in the app would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
